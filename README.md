# SplashOS üåä - Make sure to ‚≠ê the repo! Thanks

SplashAIO was my first real long term coding project. The bot itself was around 8 months of work. This is the 0.5 build which is the most recent. Many of the modules are still functioning.

## Disclaimer 

These modules included are not runnable. I reformatted them so that you could view them in the best way possible, but there is no way to actually run the file and start splash. This is because all decryption keys are removed, and imports aren't handled.

The main purpose of this code is to help out new developers with modules. Most of these modules are still working and will work great in production. You are free to use! 

## Extra

Hope you enjoy! Don't judge, was my first long term coding project so a lot of things are a bit messy. Was a great learning experience though, and I hope this code can help you and your bot!

Some modules have also been removed, but most are inside of the code above.
